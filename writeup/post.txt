A Bayesian model for ranking teams and a Monte Carlo simulation of stage playoff chances


Out of academic interest I considered the problem of using the Bradley-Terry model
to estimate the relative strength of the teams in OWL.
It turned out that the team strengths can be written in a closed formula,
and the results can be obtained via numerical integration.
Upon some coding I was able to obtain the strengths of the 12 teams
given only the match results of stage 3;
the results, as shown below,
are probably closer to what we expect the real strength of teams are.

Like the ELO system,
this model weighs matches against different opponents differently.
Wins against stronger teams are more significant and would increase the strength rating by a larger amount,
and vice versa.
What this model does differently is that when it takes in the result of a new match,
the strength of ALL teams are shifted accordingly.
This is in no way surprising:
if team A wins team B by 3-2 and and then team A loses to a very strong team (e.g. NYXL) by 2-3,
that team B was able to take team A to 5 maps would seem more impressive,
as we now know team A is a strong team that can take the juggernaut to 5 maps.
For an actual example,
although LA Valiant was ranked at NO.1 before the Houston-Dallas match today,
it dropped to NO.2 below NYXL after that match.
Since Houston was able to 3-0 Dallas while LA Valiant was only able to make it a 2-1,
LA Valiant seemed a bit less impressive in comparison.

There are, of course,
many shortcomings to this model,
such as its inability to account for change in team strength over time,
choice of roster, team strength on specific maps, level of preparation,
playstyles that counter each other, etc.
But since we don't have too many match results to work with,
this is a fairly robust model we can settle with for now.

 Team | Strength
---------|----------
NYE|0.794759
LAV|0.793881
BOS|0.771623
LAG|0.592349
PHI|0.589682
HOU|0.554635
LDN|0.545030
SFS|0.533645
SEO|0.505053
FLA|0.234532
DAL|0.222617
SHD|0.103564

With the team strength listed above,
I also did a Monte Carlo simulation for the playoff probabilities for stage 3.
The probabilities for entering stage 3 playoff are listed below.

 Team | Stage 3 Playoff Probability
---------|----------
BOS: 0.997843
NYE: 0.994207
LAV: 0.972150
SFS: 0.335334
PHI: 0.266565
LAG: 0.234127
HOU: 0.083109
SEO: 0.070869
LDN: 0.045795
DAL: 0.000000
FLA: 0.000000
SHD: 0.000000


Some take aways from the results:

* NYE, LAV and BOS are the 1-st tier teams of stage 3, with strength quite close to each other at around 0.78. 
LAG, PHI, HOU, LDN, SFS and SEO seem to be at the 2-nd tier, with strength ranging from 0.5 to 0.6,
but they all have at least 30% chance to win over the 1-st tier teams,
so none of them are to be underestimated.
DAL and FLA are at the 3-rd tier, with strengths around 0.2.
It is not particular likely for them to win over any of the higher tier teams.
Sadly, from the numbers I can only infer that SHD is at the 4-th tier,
not likely to win over any other team just yet.

* NYE, LAV and BOS pretty much have their stage playoff spots locked up. Unless they screw up the rest of their matches horribly we will see them in the playoffs.

* SFS, PHI and LAG are the contenders for that 4-th spot in the stage playoff. 
The next two weeks are going to be rough on these teams;
there is no match in which they can afford to underperform
since at this point every map win can give one of these teams the edge over another.
